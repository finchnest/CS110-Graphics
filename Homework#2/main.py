########################
def make_oval(canvas: Canvas, center: tuple, radius_x: float, radius_y: float, fill: str='hotpink'):
    '''
    Draws an oval to the canvas, centered at the given center, and with the given radius.
    
    Args: 
        canvas(Canvas): a Canvas object where you want the oval to be drawn.
        center(tuple): a tuple that defines the center point, where the first
            element in the tuple refers to the x-coordinate and the second element
            in the tuple refers to the y-coordinate.
        radius_x(int): an int that specifies the radius of the oval
            in the x-direction.
        radius_y(int): an int that specifies the radius of the oval
            in the y-direction.
        fill(str, optional): a string that represents the color of the circle, 
            defaults to hotpink.
    Returns: 
        Nothing. This function's job is to draw something to the screen. It
        does not return a value.
    '''
    # Exercise 1: currently, this function creates a hard-coded oval with a top-left
    # coordinate of (100, 100), and a bottom-right coordinate of (200, 150). Your job is 
    # to modify the code so that the top-left (x, y) and bottom-right (x, y) coordinates 
    # are calculated based on the radius_x, radius_y and center point specified by the arguments; 
    # and that the fill color is  determined by the fill argument.

    Draws a circle to the canvas, centered at the given center, and with the given radius.
    
    Args: 
        canvas(Canvas): a Canvas object where you want the oval to be drawn.
        center(tuple): a tuple that defines the center point, where the first
            element in the tuple refers to the x-coordinate and the second element
            in the tuple refers to the y-coordinate.
        radius(int): an int that specifies the radius of the circle.

    # to modify the code so that the top-left (x, y) and bottom-right (x, y) coordinates 
    # are calculated based on the radius and center point specified by arguments; 
    # and that the fill color is  determined by the fill argument.

def make_face(canvas: Canvas, center: tuple, width: int):
    '''
    Draws a face (i.e. a circle) with two eyes (i.e. ovals) to the `canvas`, 
    centered at `center,` and with a face  width of `width`.
    
    Args: 
        canvas(Canvas): a Canvas object where you want the oval to be drawn.
        center(tuple): a tuple that defines the center point, where the first
            element in the tuple refers to the x-coordinate and the second element

def make_bullseye(canvas: Canvas, center: tuple, radius: int, distance: int=10):
    '''
    Draws a bullseye of 4 concentric circles to the `canvas`, centered at `center.`
    The smallest  concentric circle has a radius of `radius` (value of the argument), and each 
    additional concentric circle has a radius of `distance` units more that the previous 
    circle. For instance, if `radius`=10 and `distance`=5, then the first circle has a 
    radius of 10, the second a radius of 15, the third 20, and the fourth 25.
    
    Args: 
        canvas(Canvas): a Canvas object where you want the oval to be drawn.
        center(tuple): a tuple that defines the center point, where the first
            element in the tuple refers to the x-coordinate and the second element
            in the tuple refers to the y-coordinate.
        radius(int): an int that specifies the radius of the circle.
        distance(int): a int that represents how far apart each circle should be drawn.
    Returns: 
        Nothing. This function's job is to draw something to the screen. It
        does not return a value.
